# Batch images compress tool

This is a CLI tool to compress multiple images (JPEG or PNG) at once using python

## Usage

To use this tool, you can do **either**:

### Pip and run

```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/thaiminhpv/batch-jpeg-compressor@main
```

then

```shell
batch_jpeg_compressor [start directory] [end directory]
```

### Run from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thaiminhpv/batch-jpeg-compressor
cd batch-jpeg-compressor
```

```

### Or run directly from executable file

Download the [executable file](https://github.com/thaiminhpv/batch-jpeg-compressor/releases/download/v0.1/batch_jpeg_compressor) and just run it directly (without installing python!)

```shell
./batch_jpeg_compressor [start directory] [end directory]
```
